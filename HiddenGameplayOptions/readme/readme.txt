Overview
~~~~~~~~

The Enhanced Editions provide a great number of settings that are not directly accessible in the 
in-game options menu, but instead have to be manually enabled or disabled in the game's 
configuration file which might discourage less computer-savvy players from using them at all.

This mods adds a number of useful options directly to the game, which includes the (in)famous 
debug console, various graphics and feedback settings, and more.

All Enhanced Edition games patched to v2.0 or higher are supported.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive 
into your game directory and run "setup-HiddenGameplayOptions.exe".


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mod supports all Enhanced Edition games patched to v2.0 or higher. It is also compatible with 
Pecca's "Dragonspear UI++" and Lefreut's Enhanced UI (LeUI). Some options may be moved into other 
sections when these mods have been detected.

Patching UI definition files can be tricky. To ensure that a failed patch attempt does not corrupt 
the game it will fail with a forced error and restore the original state of the patched files.
