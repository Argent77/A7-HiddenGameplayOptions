Overview
~~~~~~~~

The Enhanced Editions provide a great number of settings that are not directly accessible in the 
in-game options. Instead they have to be manually enabled or disabled directly in the game's 
configuration file which might discourage less computer-savvy players to use them at all.

This mods adds a number of useful options directly to the game, which includes the debug console, 
various options to display additional gameplay information and more. You can find them in the 
'Gameplay' section of the Options menu.

All Enhanced Edition games patched to v2.0 or higher are supported.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive 
into your game directory and run "setup-MoreGameplayOptions.exe".


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install more Gameplay options (main component)

This component allows you to choose whether to install selected options individually or all at once.


The following options are only available when you choose to select options individually:

2. Add in-game option "Enable Debug Console"

Allows you to enable cheat keys and the debug console in the game.


3. Add in-game option "Show trigger icons on tab"

Setting this option reveals more information about interactive regions when pressing the TAB key.


4. Add in-game option "Show extra combat info"

Setting this option displays all factors that influence an attack roll.


5. Add in-game option "Show Game Date and Time on Pause"

Setting this option shows game date and time when activating pause.


6. Add in-game option "Disable Fog"

Setting this option disables fog effects on maps.


7. Add in-game option "Limits druidic spells for Cleric/Ranger"

Setting this option limits druidic spell levels to level 3 for Cleric/Rangers (as per D&D rules).


Note: Patching UI definition files can be tricky. To ensure that a failed patch attempt does not 
      corrupt the game the mod will fail with a forced error and restore the original state of 
      the patched files.
