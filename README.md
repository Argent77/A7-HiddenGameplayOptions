# Reveal Hidden Gameplay Options
*A mod that makes a number of useful options directly accessible within Enhanced Edition games.*

## Overview
The Enhanced Editions provide a great number of settings that are not directly accessible in the in-game options menu, but instead have to be manually enabled or disabled in the game's configuration file which might discourage less computer-savvy players from using them at all.

This mods adds a number of useful options directly to the game, which includes the (in)famous debug console, various graphics and feedback settings, and more.

*All Enhanced Edition games patched to v2.0 or higher are supported.*
